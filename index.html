    <h2>Hello I'm</h2>
    <h1>ROCK RIMON</h1>
    <p>Iâ€™m a web developer. I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; dabbling with Python and Ruby; and inhaling a wide variety of potentially useless information through a few hundred RSS feeds. I build websites that delight and inform. I do it well.I do my best to stay on top of changes in the state of the art so that I can meet challenges with tools well suited to the job at hand.</p>
